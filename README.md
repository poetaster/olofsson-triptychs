# olofsson-triptychs
Supercollider ndef compositions using instruments made by Fredrik Olofsson

The origins are at https://sccode.org/1-4Qy and consist of SC tweets that Olofsson published on twitter.

I have taken them and made them playable using Ndefs and assembled sequences of three to compose a series of triptychs.
